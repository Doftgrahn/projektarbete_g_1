          eager to share the beauty within them.<br>
          They are the seemingly meaningless moments we all tend to overlook.<br>
          Serenity unveils these moments and reminds you to experience them with joy.<br>
          Whether it’s taking a nice long bath or creating a homey atmosphere with the rich scent of Asian incense,
          <br>Serenity allows you to find happiness in the smallest of things.</p>
